# ✅ Facial Analysis Accuracy Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. 👁️ **Eye Contact Tracking - IMPROVED**

**Problems Fixed:**
- ❌ Was too sensitive to minor gaze movements
- ❌ Scored too harshly
- ❌ Used single iris landmark (inaccurate)

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Now uses **average of all 5 iris landmarks** for each eye
- ✅ More forgiving thresholds:
  - **0-10% deviation from center = 100% score** (perfect)
  - **10-25% deviation = 80-100% score** (good)
  - **>25% deviation = gradually decreases** (needs improvement)
- ✅ Better clamping and normalization

**Result:** More realistic scores that match actual eye contact quality!

---

### 2. 💪 **Confidence Score - RECALIBRATED**

**Problems Fixed:**
- ❌ Too strict penalties for small head movements
- ❌ Unrealistic baseline expectations

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **More forgiving head pose thresholds:**
  - Yaw (left-right): ±20° is good (was ±15°)
  - Pitch (up-down): ±15° is good (was ±10°)
  - Roll (tilt): ±10° is good (was ±5°)

- ✅ **Adjusted weights** (more realistic):
  - Eye contact: 35% (was 40%)
  - Head pose: 30% (was 25%)
  - Eye openness: 20% (same)
  - Face stability: 15% (same)

- ✅ **Added 10% boost** for more realistic baseline scores
- ✅ Better eye openness normalization (×1.2 multiplier)

**Result:** Confidence scores now reflect actual performance without being too harsh!

### 3. ⚡ **Engagement Score - REFINED**

**Problems Fixed:**
- ❌ Penalized silent/listening moments too much
- ❌ Didn't account for natural speaking patterns

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Smart mouth activity scoring:**
  - Low (0-0.2) = 70% engagement (listening is OK!)
  - Medium (0.2-0.5) = 85% engagement (normal speaking)
  - High (0.5+) = 100% engagement (animated speaking)

- ✅ **Added expressiveness factor** (15% weight)
  - Combines eye and mouth animation
  - Rewards natural facial expressions

- ✅ **Adjusted weights:**
  - Eye contact: 30%
  - Eye openness: 30%
  - Mouth activity: 25%
  - Expressiveness: 15%

- ✅ **Added 15% boost** (interviews naturally show engagement)

**Result:** Engagement scores now recognize that listening and thinking are part of interviews!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Scores Showing 0% or Very Low

**Check:**
1. Good lighting on face
2. Face visible in webcam frame
3. Camera at eye level
4. No obstructions

**Browser Console Logs:**
```
Look for these warnings:
- "[WARNING] Eye contact calculation error"
- "[WARNING] Face stability calculation error"
```

### Scores Not Updating

**Fix:**
1. Check backend logs for MediaPipe errors
2. Verify webcam permissions granted
3. Ensure face is detected (check emotion detection works)
4. Refresh page and try again

### Scores Seem Inaccurate

**Remember:**
- Look **directly at camera lens**, not screen
- Maintain distance: 2-3 feet from camera
- Keep face fully visible
- Good lighting from front, not behind
